        <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>This caramel macchiato banana bread features a coffee-infused loaf and a rich caramel glaze. Baking banana bread is one of my favorite things to do.
             I love nothing more than enjoying a slice with a nice cup of coffee — that’s what inspired this recipe!</p>

        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
             <ul>
                <li>cooking spray</li>

                <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>

                <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>

                <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>

                <li>½ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>

                <li>⅛ teaspoon salt</li>

                <li>large very ripe bananas</li>

                <li>½ cup caramel macchiato-flavored liquid coffee creamer (such as International Delight)</li>

                <li>⅔ cup white sugar</li>

                <li>½ cup vegetable oil</li>

                <li>2 eggs</li>

                <li>2 tablespoons instant coffee granules</li>

                <li>6 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>

                <li>6 tablespoons packed brown sugar</li>

                <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            </ul>

        <h4>Directions</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 9x5-inch loaf pan with cooking spray. </li>
                <li>Whisk flour, baking soda, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt together in a bowl.</li>
                <li>Mash bananas in a large mixing bowl with a fork until almost smooth. Stir in coffee creamer, sugar, oil, eggs, and instant coffee granules until coffee granules have dissolved. Gradually stir in
                    flour mixture, about 1/2 cup at a time, until batter is almost smooth. Pour batter into the prepared loaf pan. </li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of the loaf comes out clean, about 1 hour. 
                    Allow to cool before removing from pan, about 30 minutes. </li>
                <li>While the bread is cooling, melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Mix in brown sugar and vanilla and bring to a boil, stirring to dissolve sugar. Reduce the heat and simmer syrup for 3 minutes.
                     Remove from the heat and let cool to a warm but liquid temperature. </li>    
                <li>Pour glaze over cooled banana bread. Serve when glaze has set. </li>
            </ol>
