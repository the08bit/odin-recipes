        <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>If these lemon ricotta pancakes were any lighter, they would float off the plate! 
            They are easy to make and delicious served with a pat of butter, lemon zest, 
            and a drizzle of maple syrup. </p>

        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
             <ul>
                <li>¾ cup cold water or milk</li>

                <li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li>

                <li>½ cup ricotta cheese</li>

                <li>1 large egg</li>

                <li>1 tablespoon grated lemon zest</li>

                <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>

                <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>

                <li>⅛ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>

                <li>1 cup self-rising flour</li>

                <li>2 tablespoons self-rising flour</li>

                <li>2 tablespoons melted butter</li>

                <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
            </ul>

        <h4>Directions</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Whisk cold water and baking soda in a mixing bowl. Add ricotta cheese, egg, lemon zest, 
                    vegetable oil, sugar, and vanilla; whisk until smooth, breaking up any lumps of cheese as you mix. </li>

                <li>Whisk in 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons self-rising flour, melted butter, and lemon juice 
                    until most of flour disappears into batter. Let batter sit at room temperature for 15 minutes. </li>

                <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle over medium-high heat.</li>

                <li>Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the hot griddle and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 
                    2 to 3 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining 
                    batter. </li>
            </ol>
